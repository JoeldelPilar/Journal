# Description

Starting October 2022. I began my education - <b>Front End Developer</b> - at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, Sweden.

Here I will share my personal insights, things I learn and thoughts. Also the goal is to describe breakthroughs, frustrations etc.

This is mainly for my personal growth but if it can help others, no one is happier than me.

/cheers!
