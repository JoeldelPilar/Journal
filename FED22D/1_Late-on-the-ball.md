# Late on the ball! :bulb: !!!

Well its Jan, 2023 - Happy Newish year ( 28th to be exact). <br>

I started this program in October so I guess I'm late on the ball?<br>

I got this idea from one of my teachers, to logg my progress, insights etc, so here we go.

Currently I'm on the 4th course now, looking back I'v learn so much. All courses have started the same: PANIC!<br>
All things that needs to be done, assignment and so on. That got me to reflect over the past few months.<br>
I'v learnd SO much, to me it's almost insane. The amount of new knowledge I learned, more than the last 2-3 years<br>
combined for sure! Feels amazing.

## Some insights that can be good to write down:

- Trust your teatcher! Like a Pilot he or she knows where your going and knows how to get there, just relax in your seat<br>
  and follow the instructions, you will get there in due time.

- Coding isen't plug Â´n play. I finnished my last assignment before christmas one week before deadline. Sure it was awesome to <br>
  get the free time of with family but remember, you took time of to study and time is so so soo valueble! You can not get it back!<br>
  Even if I was done, I should have givien 30 to 60 min a day to just write code, or create something, try something. Getting back to<br>
  the new course after the holiday, totaly wrong mindset! I wasen't in the flow, i missed out and stressed out, for nothing! The day <br>
  before we started I had panic, again, over the new assignment. Turned out to be the most awesome course so far! I finally go to try out<br>
  Vue.js and I loved it!, long tip short, keep your mind fresh! Take breaks, but not whole weeks!

## IMPOSTER!!! or...?

- Starting this process of recaping, going through all I'v learnd etc, it really got me thinking. Late last night I could not sleep, my mind<br>
  was spinning at 110%.<br>

I realized that I have compared myself to the others in my class. I'v stressed out when someone finnished a linkedin-learning course, or took a <br>
certificate. When somone asked a question during class that was out of scoope of my knowledge, I have almost freaked out, thinking - I don't know <br>
anything about programming och frond end development. I think

Looking on others code made me feel like a cheater! am I just coping stuff and getting grades based of other peoples hard work?<br>

All of this have stired like a slow-cooked stew, and I just realized it!!<br>

### I'm me, not you. Your you, not me!<br>

- Finnaly last night I snapped out of the negative and started analyzing. This line of work that I'm embarking on to learn, it's maybe the widest knowledge<br>
  range of all categorys of work! What I like and whant to do isen't maybe whats cut out for the next person in the same branch? I need to focus on how I whant to<br>
  work and draw inspiration from others, not comparing. This line of work is a life long journey of learning. New technologies are coming like a bullet spray and <br>
  a part of the job is to keep up with the flow.

I'm never going to know it ALL! And, in the future there will be a whole team creating awesome stuff... togheter! It's not about me, I can be part of somthing bigger!<br>

In the course graphic design we had a group assignment, 4 ppl, and together we learned Vue.js, in 2 weeks! Ok we dident learn to hack around it all but we made something!<br>
Something that worked!! It was a team effort. You are you, I'm me, lets learn to together, we are <b>not</b> imposters! We are co-learners!
