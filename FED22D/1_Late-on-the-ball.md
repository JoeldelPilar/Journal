# Late on the ball! :bulb: !!!

Well its Jan, 2023 - Happy Newish year ( 28th to be exact).

I got this idea from one of my teachers, to logg my progress, insights etc, so here we go.

Currently I'm on the 4th course now, looking back I'v learn so much. All courses have started the same: PANIC!<br>
All things that needs to be done, assignment and so on. That got me to reflect over the past few months.<br>
I'v learnd SO much, to me it's almost insane. The amount of new knowledge I learned, more than the last 2-3 years<br>
combined for sure! Feels amazing.

Some insights that can be good to write down:

- Trust your teatcher! Like a Pilot he or she knows where your going and knows how to get there, just relax in your seat<br>
  and follow the instructions, you will get there in due time.

- Coding isen't plug Â´n play. I finnished my last assignment before christmas one week before deadline. Sure it was awesome to <br>
  get the free time of with family but remember, you took time of to study and time is so so soo valueble! You can not get it back!<br>
  Even if I was done, I should have givien 30 to 60 min a day to just write code, or create something, try something. Getting back to<br>
  the new course after the holiday, totaly wrong mindset! I wasen't in the flow, i missed out and stressed out, for nothing! The day <br>
  before we started I had panic, again, over the new assignment. Turned out to be the most awesome course so far! I finally go to try out<br>
  Vue.js and I loved it!, long tip short, keep your mind fresh! Take breaks, but not whole weeks!
