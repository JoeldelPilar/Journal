# Under Pressure

This week was a tough one! Last week we started off learning testing with Jest! Test driven development is something I want to learn more about and get better at. 

As I said, this week was tough! I diden't understand all the concepts plus I catched a bad cold with fever and severe headache, top that with Jest mocks and 
new concepts about API and axios! Now there you have a party! except there is now fun, no cake and nobody showing up! 

I was mega frustrated, no inspiration and coding felt like it lost all of its joy! I tried to follow the resoning that was going on among my friends in class, but I
wasen't getting much. Don't get me wrong, my class mates are awesome! I could spend hours celebrating how much they helpt me and how genuine they are, just this time
it all went over my head!

Happy news though! I finally made sense of it all! And as allways: TALK TO THE DUCK! How often do I just RUN, run heads on with the task, not thinking, not allowing
myself to understand the code, I rush, want to get things <b>DONE<b>. I though that I never would finish this assignment but I did, 3 day ahead! 

  
## Take-aways
  - slowdown, do I understand what the code is doing?
  - read the flow in the application, what happens and when!
  - BREATH!!!!
  - Ask questions!!! Dummie! (We all want to be the best! The guy, the gal, that everyone ask for awesome solutions, *reality check knocking* - you can't excell 
  in everything, find your strenght, elevate them, find your weaknesses, ask questions, get better but don't try to play soccer with a hockey stick!)
