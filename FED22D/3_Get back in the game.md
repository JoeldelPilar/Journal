# Post summer 2023

Well, I haven't gotten around to coding as much as I'd hoped over the summer break. A lot of work came in between and then I've had to prioritize rest. <br>

Now when I open up my projects where I last left them... have I written this? What does this code actually do?! But after a while it starts to clear up a little. <br>
I must go easy on myself. I've actually only tested react for about two weeks. <br>

I think it was useful for me to rest and not only work this summer. After all, I've made a pretty big change in life.<br>
Going from working full-time for more than 15 years to studying full-time, towards a completely new field of work, it has been a big step.<br>
Time has gone by so fast and I haven't even had time to reflect on all the new things I've learned.<br>

I'm looking forward to what the coming semester has in store. For the most part, I want to finish this react course and start my internship in October.<br>
